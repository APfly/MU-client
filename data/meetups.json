We will have one BBQ event each month at a different location from May to September:</p> <p>Here is a little history of Gas Works Park:</p> <p>This 20 acre point on Lake Union was cleared in 1906 to construct a plant to manufacture gas from coal - later converted to crude oil. Import of natural gas in the 1950's made the plant obsolete. The city acquired the site and the park was opened to the public in 1975. The boiler house has been converted to a picnic shelter with tables, fire grills and an open area. The former exhauster-compressor building, now a children's play barn, features a maze of brightly painted machinery.</p> <p>Friends, family and pets are welcome!</p> <p>Cost of the BBQ is $10 per person.</p> <p>BBQ starts at 12noon and we will be there at 11:30am to set up stuff, it is much appreciated if you could come early and give us a hand.</p> <p>We have reserved tables #1 and 2 in the BBQ area next to the boiler house and there will be signs saying that the tables and grills are reserved for Meetup event.</p> <p>When you arrive please check in with the event hosts.</p> <p>There will be vegetarian options!!!</p> <p>*A few other Meetup groups are also invited to this event*</p> ",

It affects their confidence, their ability to succeed in a business world, and the way others perceive them.</p> <p>This is a simple and informal gathering over coffee, tea, or other drink. Everyone is welcome - young or old, married or single! Even if your English is perfect, you are welcome to help others practice their English. Also, please pass along information about this group to your friends who might be interested.</p> <p>The purpose is to encourage making new friends with whom you can practice speaking English. Conversations will be casual, but we'll be sure to discuss topics related to American culture and traditions as well as English vocabulary, grammar, slang, and idioms.</p> <p>We'll be gathering around 7pm for a couple of hours of talk on Monday evenings at the Starbucks located in downtown Bellevue across from Bellevue Square Mall on NE 8th Avenue. It is walking distance from the Bellevue Transit Center for those of you who travel by bus.</p> <p>For those of you driving by car, there is free parking at the parking lot. Alternative free parking is available nearby at the Bellevue Square Mall and the Lincoln Square parking garages.</p> <p>Here is the Google map and information for the Starbucks: <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/gcnBRxpsGkM2\" class=\"linkified\">https://goo.gl/maps/gcnBRxpsGkM2</a></p> <p>We look forward to seeing everyone there for a warm and friendly evening of conversation!</p> <p>P.S. - If you need someone to give you a ride to the Starbucks, please make note of this when you RSVP or contact us directly.
