We will have one BBQ event each month at a different location from May to September:</p> <p>Here is a little history of Gas Works Park:</p> <p>This 20 acre point on Lake Union was cleared in 1906 to construct a plant to manufacture gas from coal - later converted to crude oil. Import of natural gas in the 1950's made the plant obsolete. The city acquired the site and the park was opened to the public in 1975. The boiler house has been converted to a picnic shelter with tables, fire grills and an open area. The former exhauster-compressor building, now a children's play barn, features a maze of brightly painted machinery.</p> <p>Friends, family and pets are welcome!</p> <p>Cost of the BBQ is $10 per person.</p> <p>BBQ starts at 12noon and we will be there at 11:30am to set up stuff, it is much appreciated if you could come early and give us a hand.</p> <p>We have reserved tables #1 and 2 in the BBQ area next to the boiler house and there will be signs saying that the tables and grills are reserved for Meetup event.</p> <p>When you arrive please check in with the event hosts.</p> <p>There will be vegetarian options!!!</p> <p>*A few other Meetup groups are also invited to this event*</p> ", "how_to_find_us": "picnic tables #1 & #2",

      "description": "<p>This date may change, I want to see how many people want to go.</p> <p>The max is 24 but I can change it if more people want to come.</p> <p>There’s only two large rooms and those rooms can hold 12 people comfortably.<br/>If more people want to show up then that is fine but they will have to be in a separate smaller room. The karaoke is in the room and I can also serve you beer and chicken everything you want while you’re singing in the room. And if you come and you’re under 21, we can do one room that is non-drinking and the other room with drinks. They are extremely strict on this so be warned</p> <p>I will offer to give people rides if you come to the U district. Only four people can fit in my car. I’m sure there’s other people who would give a ride to others as well.</p> ",
